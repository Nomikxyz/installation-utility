# installation-utility
Python installation utility for long package lists. 

Created out of @javathunderman's frustration for having to manually install a ton of dependencies at once. This utility reads a .nomcsv file (created to prevent confusion with other CSV files) that you can fill with packages to install. It reads and installs them one by one. 

The GUI version has a few more bells and whistles, like being able to edit the installation command without editing the script's source code and being able to edit the installation lists without using another text editor. 

# Dependencies

- Python
- Tkinter (for the GUI version)
